## Kameleo Features

### 1. Profile Management
Kameleo's industry-leading profile management allows users to modify the browser fingerprint for each virtual browser profile. This ensures websites perceive distinct browsers originating from different devices and locations. Profiles can be saved and shared with teams, granting access to cookies, logins, and browsing history.

With Intelligent Canvas Spoofing Technology, Kameleo bypasses modern bot detection systems, reducing the risk of account bans and enhancing profile authenticity.

### 2. Mobile Fingerprint Options
Kameleo provides two innovative mobile browsing options:
- **Real Android Devices**: Authentic mobile browsing with natural gestures and touch events, perfect for triggering fingerprint detection algorithms.
- **Custom-built Chromium**: A mobile browser emulator that eliminates the need for physical Android devices while maintaining seamless functionality.

This flexibility allows users to choose the best option for their browsing needs.

### 3. Unlimited Browser Profiles
Unlike many competitors, Kameleo offers an unlimited number of browser profiles, enabling users to scale their operations without restrictions.

### 4. Cookie Editor Tool
Kameleo's robust cookie editor simplifies cookie management and manipulation, giving users control over their online browsing data.

### 5. Canvas Spoofing
Canvas fingerprinting is a technique used by advertisers to track users even with ad blockers. Kameleo disguises this fingerprint, making it harder for trackers to identify you.
