## Key Features of Multilogin

### 1. Two Browser Engines

Multilogin provides two custom-built browsers tailored for maximum security and performance:
- **Mimic Browser**: Built on the Chromium engine (similar to Google Chrome), Mimic prevents the transmission of actual PC profiles during browsing.
- **Stealthfox Browser**: Based on the Firefox engine, Stealthfox excels at managing digital fingerprints and offers advanced customization for secure browsing.

### 2. Browser Fingerprint Customization

Creating unique browser profiles is effortless with Multilogin. Users can quickly generate profiles by choosing their preferred operating system, browser type, and proxies. The **Quick Profile** option allows for temporary sessions with minimal setup, while more advanced users can manually adjust fingerprint settings.

Customizable settings include:
- Screen resolution, language, and user agent.
- Proxy configurations.
- Disabling/enabling WebRTC and browser plugins.

### 3. Task Automation

Multilogin simplifies automation by integrating with popular tools like Selenium and Puppeteer. Businesses can programmatically create and manage profiles, automate repetitive tasks such as account creation, and even perform advanced actions like social media engagement.

The API enables developers to streamline operations, saving resources on fingerprint emulation and web scraping.

### 4. Teamwork 2.0

Collaborating on online account management has never been easier. Multilogin allows team members to share profiles, set permissions, and manage accounts efficiently. For instance, you can restrict a team member’s access to view-only mode or limit it to specific clients.
